# Checkers

## Basic Requirements

Build a single-page app implementation of Checkers using Express and React.

- Use Express to serve up an `index.html` file and its associated assets
- Build your UI using ReactJS and pre-compile your views using Babel
- Implement all the game logic in the client code

To satisfy the basic requirements of this challenge, simplify gamplay by allowing only single forward jumps. Detect when no more jumps can occur and declare a winner or tie. Write tests to verify your win/tie detection logic.

Apply a *minimal* amount of CSS styling so that your board *resembles* a Checkers board. Do not spend any significant amount of time (30 min max) on styling: aim for resemblance, not similarity.

Follow all the best practices you've learned in the prior challenges in this challenge too.

No hints are provided for this challenge. Make any assumptions you feel are necessary to move forward.

## Advanced Content

- Allow players to be kinged and jump backwards too.
- Add support for multiple consecutive jumps in either direction.
- Implement all the nuanced rules for deciding on a winner or tie.
- Add more Mocha and write tests to verify your rules are correct.
- Separate your React components into their own files and configure webpack-dev to load those components into your client.
- If not already done, use flex-box styling.

## Nightmare Mode

- Make a single player version of the game, where you play against the computer.
